# AI World Landscape

## Research Questions

1. **RQ1**: What kind of AI applications do people build?

   **Expect result**: Set proper categories, assign each AI application to a proper category.

   **data**:

   - find all 

   **Methods**: 

   - Using text clustering method to cluster projects' documents. Here documents includes but not limited to readme, code comment

2. **RQ2**: How do people use AI frameworks?

   **Expect result**: Set properly network architectures. Link those architectures with each category's application. See Whether applications is tightly associated with architectures.

   **Implication**: Provide guide to developers when they want to build applications in some categorization on choosing architectures.

3. **RQ3**: Can developers benefit from tutorials?

   **Expect result**: Based on RQ1 result, choose tutorials in each categories, get each developer's development trace. Check whether those developers with tutorials have a higher ratio than those without tutorials creating corresponding applications.

   **Implications**: Get useful tutorials for each category.
